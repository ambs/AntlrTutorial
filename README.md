# Logo2Svg

This tool converts a program in the LOGO programming language into its resulting image, in SVG.
It was written as a tutorial for C# and ANTLR programming. The links to each part of this tutorial
are presented below.

The implementation is not complete. Contributions are welcome.

## Documentation
